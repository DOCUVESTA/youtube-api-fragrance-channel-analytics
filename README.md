## Overview
What better way to discover new products than through a recommendation? It's pre-vetted and, if you're lucky, it includes a detailed breakdown of the product's pros and cons. Nowadays, if we're considering buying a new sunscreen, lotion, or perfume, it's likely because we've seen it highlighted by an influencer on social media. For this project, I analyze Monika Cioch's YouTube channel, which is largely dedicated to reviewing, discovering, and recommending perfumes. This analysis aims to understand her viewers' preferences by examining engagement metrics such as views, likes, and comments count to determine which of her videos performs the best.

## Data Context

<table style="width:100%">

    <tr>

## Key Insights
- Monika's audience prefers review videos. Although they make up just 11.7% of her content, review videos receive the highest number of views and comments, with likes trailing only slightly behind Youtube shorts by less than 1,000 likes
- Based on all three engagement metrics, longform content tend to generally outperform shortform content
- The top 4 videos that consistently rank in the top 10 are about the types of perfumes that men would find appealing on women ðŸ‘€ 



<br>

## Future Work
- Comments analysis
- Classify using more specific categories
- Include the variable of time: Are the best performing videos the ones that have been up the longest?
